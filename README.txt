The app that I created is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 
The game is the classic where you input your choice then the computer randomly chooses one and then it will tell you its choice and whether you won or lost. 

To run this you can us the command: 
python Game.py

Or if you want to pull the docker image you can use the following command:
docker run -it balo0025/assignment-4.3
